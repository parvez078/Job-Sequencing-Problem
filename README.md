# Job-Sequencing-Problem
You are given two arrays: deadline[], and profit[], which represent a set of jobs, where each job is associated with a deadline, and a profit. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete, and only one job can be scheduled at a time. You will earn the profit associated with a job only if it is completed by its deadline.
